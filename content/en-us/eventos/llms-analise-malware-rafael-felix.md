[Rafael Félix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/~biscoito/) delivers an advanced, hands‑on demonstration of how Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping malware analysis. As Offensive Development Lead at HAKAI, Rafael shows live integrations between classic reverse‑engineering tools, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra, and AI models, turning obfuscated assembly into clear, annotated, and actionable analysis.

Using a real sample from MalwareBazaar, the session demonstrates live identification of evasion techniques (like process injection), intelligent function renaming, useful explanatory comments, automated YARA rule generation, and reconstruction of a readable C++ (or other systems language) source version. This is practical work, not theory, designed to drastically speed up reverse engineering, democratize expertise, and equip attendees to implement these techniques immediately.
