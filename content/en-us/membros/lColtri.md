### Analyzing this profile? Permission granted.

My philosophy is simple: to truly protect a system, you must know it better than any adversary. This is the mission that guides my journey.

#### Where I Come From: The Tactical Training
It all begins with mastering the tools. My journey started at **IFSULDEMINAS**, where I trained as an **IT Technician**. There, I forged my technical toolkit: I learned the language of code, the logic of systems, and the art of solving complex problems. It was intensive training to operate in the field, understanding each digital component and how to use it with precision.

#### Where I Am: The Strategic Vision
But tools are only effective when you know the terrain. Curiosity brought me to **Telecommunications Engineering at Unicamp**. Here, I am learning to see the complete map of the digital landscape. Not just the endpoints, but the entire invisible infrastructure: the communication networks, the protocols, and the architecture that underpins everything. It's the high-level perspective, essential for surveillance and defense.

#### Where I'm Going: Proactive Defense
My focus is **Cybersecurity**. Because to protect a network, it's not enough to master the tools; you must understand the infrastructure better than the attackers. My goal is to merge tactical agility with strategic knowledge for a single mission: to design and defend digital systems that are not just functional, but resilient, maintaining order and security in the digital environment.

**So, why are you here?**

* **Looking for a specialist?** Excellent. You need someone who not only neutralizes the threat (the code) but also understands the architecture (the network) to predict and nullify the next attack vector. My projects and qualifications are detailed on [GitHub](https://github.com/lColtri) and [LinkedIn](lu%C3%ADza-coltri-costa).

* **Looking for an ally?** Even better. If you are also dedicated to protecting the integrity of the network, send a signal through my channels. The work is never done.
